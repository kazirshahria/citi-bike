# Citi Bike Dashboard

## A dashboard on the Citi Bike rides from Jan-Jun 2025

The Citi Bike provides free and accessible data on trips and stations at [**Citi Bike - System Data**](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data).

There are 5 boroughs in NYC and 4/5 that support the use of Citi bikes. These boroughs are:

- Manhattan
- Brooklyn
- Queens
- The Bronx

With this dashboard, state members, city officials, and company stakeholders are able to adjust bike funding, optimize marketing campaigns, and understand its users.

## Project Workflow

This is a diagram created in [**Lucidchart**](https://www.lucidchart.com/) that shows the workflow before building the dashboard:
