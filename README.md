# ðŸš² Citi Bike Ridership Project

The Citi Bike stations in NYC are spread across the five boroughs and easily accessible for locals or tourists. There are thousands of trips happening everyday, some people are going to work, working out, riding with friends, exploring the city, and more. 

This project is to analyze trips, gather insights, and understand performance on a month to month basis.
